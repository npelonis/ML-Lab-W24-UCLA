### This folder contains assignments and in-class exercises from my Machine Learning Course at UCLA. 

These contain a mixture of work I did myself, work on which I received help from a professor, and other files I worked on with other students. 

The purpose of this README file is to inform any readers or hiring managers that this is not my portfolio of work, but a collection of academic coursework. 

With that said, feel free to look if you'd like!
